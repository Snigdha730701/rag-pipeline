FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that do not fit in RAM.
FAISS is commonly used for building vector databases for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.
